The objective is to use experimental data as a support to evaluate the reliability of a model or to solve parameter estimation problems. The topic is divided according to two main objectives. 

1. Confronting experimental observations with numerical predictions

a. Uncertainty propagation

Title
  Uncertainty analaysis for measurement of water adsorption in a porous material
  a definition.
Short Abstract
  Using a DVS equipment, several sorption isotherm are measured for a sample of woodfibre material. Since the measurement data have some discrepancy, the question is how to obtain a good estimate of the measure?
