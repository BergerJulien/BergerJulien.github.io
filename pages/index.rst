This page is devoted to the works carried during the Momentum Meetings on the modelling of heat and mass transfer in building porous materials and their interaction with ambient air. The works are gathered in three parts.

1. `Building a model`_

The objective is to work on the elaboration of both mathematical and numerical models to predict and investigate the physical phenomena.

2. `Experimental investigations as a support of modelling`_

Here, the experimental data are used as a support to evaluate the reliability of a model or to solve parameter estimation problems.

3. General tools
