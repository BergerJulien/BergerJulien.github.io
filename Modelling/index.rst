The objective is to work on the elaboration of both mathematical and numerical models to predict the physical phenomena of heat and mass transfer in building porous media.

The distinction is made between the *mathematical* and *numerical* model. The primer one includes the governing equations of the physical phenomena. The later is used to obtain a solution of the governing equations.


1. Defining a Mathematical Model

2. Building a Numerical Model
