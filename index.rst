This site is devoted to the works carried during the Momentum Meetings on the modelling of heat and mass transfer in building porous materials and their interaction with ambient air. The works are gathered in three parts. 

As illustrated in Figure 1, several steps can be identified in the construction of a model for the prediction of heat losses through walls. First, the model is based on a qualitative representation of the *real physical* world. One can easily observe that in winter time, the heat flux is directed from the inside to the outside part of the wall. Then, this knowledge is translated into the so-called *mathematical model* [#]_. The mathematical model includes the governing equations of the physical phenomena. The third step aims at building a *numerical model*  to obtain a solution of the governing equations [#]_. 
This model can employ numerical [#]_ or analytical methods with defined discretisation of the continuous variables. Last, once the model is built, the numerical model can be developed using computational technologies so that predictions and analysis of the physical phenomena can be carried out. An alternative application is to estimate uncertain parameters entering in the definition of the model using experimental observations. The Figure 1 also illustrates the approximations introduced modeling procedure. Namely, some physical approximations are added when defining the mathematical model. Then, some numerical approximations appear when building the computational tool to solve the problem.

Thus, the site is divided according to this approach:

1. `Building a model`_

The objective is to work on the elaboration of both mathematical and numerical models to predict and investigate the physical phenomena.

2. `Experimental investigations as a support of modelling`_

Here, the experimental data are used as a support to evaluate the reliability of a model or to solve parameter estimation problems.

3. General tools

Some general tools helpfull are presented.

.. [#] Here, The word *mathematical* is used because the mathematical language is used to write the model. 
.. [#] Here, the word *numerical* is adopted in the sense of computational.
.. [#] Here, the word *numerical* stands for the type of method used to compute the solution.
